Need to create a headerfile so that cppchecker can analyse better, read the docs on how to make cppchecker work better for kernel modules.

Need to create a bashscript to collect timings accross multiple runs. 

This simple Hello World kernel driver, used pr_info instead of printk to avoid having to specify the log lvl each time (pr_info is a shorthand maro that uses KERN_INFO <<- double check).
